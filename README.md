* ## Project Description

For this project, we had to make a workday planner which will start by displaying to the user the current day of the week and the current date. The planner displays each hour-long time block rows as color coded based on if the time is in the past, present or future. The user can then click on the middle column of any time block row to input the schedule for the day, and click save to save to a local storage.

* ## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON.

* ## Challenges

I had a hard time with this homework in general. First biggest challenge was working with the 'moment.js' documentation. I did not realize it can display time as unix time if I did not format it correctly, so I had to click around for a really long time just learning the documentation. Then the biggest challenge was reviewing class material and learning how to do the local storage, which I still don't feel really sure if I obtained the info even after this homework.
